Minimal code to enable the token holders/users to buy stuff from merchants with tokens even if they don't have any ETH in their wallet so non-crypto users can use crypto easily this way. The merchants will pay for the transaction fees so they will have control over their costs. There is also a possibility to have a third party which pays for fees to let both the merchants and customers transact without any ETH
